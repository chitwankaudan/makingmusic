## GAN Approach

Reasons GANs are tough to trains:
[Why GANs are tough to train](https://medium.com/@jonathan_hui/gan-why-it-is-so-hard-to-train-generative-advisory-networks-819a86b3750b)
- Non-convergence: the model parameters oscillate, destabilize and never converge
- Mode collapse: the generator collapses which produces limited varieties of samples
- Diminished gradient: the discriminator gets too successful that the generator gradient vanishes and learns nothing

Gan structure:

- Struggled to train it to not produce random noise. At 250 epochs they found decent results but it didnâ€™t persist. They would like to try an LSTM next

Simple GAN vs. Simple RNN

- GAN is tougher to train with less impressive results than the simple RNN
